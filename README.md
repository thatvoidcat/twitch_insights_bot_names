# TwitchInsights Known Bot Lists

These are simple lists meant to be used with the [Commander Root Ban Tool](https://twitch-tools.rootonline.de/chatban_manager.php).
They are extracted from [TwitchInsights](https://twitchinsights.net/bots).

## How to use the lists

There are two types of lists, **base** and **update**.

### Base lists

Every monday I will have a full list off all the known bots. If you are starting out with banning them start with this list.

### Update lists

Update lists assume that you already used one of the base lists before. They basically contain all the bots that were added to 
Twitch Insights after a specific base list was created.

You basically just have to either add the daily list on a daily basis or the weekly lists every week to keep up to date with the current banned bots.

#### Weekly update lists

The weekly update lists contain all the bots that have been added in the last week.

#### Daily update lists

The daily update lists contain all the bots that have been added in the last day.

## Ban lists

The lists in the `ban` folder are the same as in `lists`, just with `/ban ` before each twitch username.
